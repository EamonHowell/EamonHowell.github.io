                        For my software development class, our final project was to make clue in Java. 
                        It was built from the ground up, using an Agile Methodology. We made everything 
                        from the game board to play on, how to read the board, how to get the characters 
                        to follow the rules, and how to end the game. It was a team project over the course of 
                        about a month and a half.

                        For my database management class, we were tasked with making our own database
                        on PostgreSQL, and then determine things about the data. We had to create schemas
                        for the database, clean and upload the data, and then create our SQL statements
                        to search through the database to answer questions one could have in the data.
                        We also had to analyze our searches to determine the best way to search for the
                        information. My team and I used data from

                        This project was for an introduction to data science class. 
                        The class was about doing data science with Python. It covered 
                        how to find data to use, how to clean it, analyze it, and then use 
                        the data to figure out something about the world from the data. 
                        The project was part of our final, where we had to perform everything that we 
                        had learned thus far. I had chosen to find SAT score data and school
                        funding data. I was trying to determine just what the effect of changing
                        funding for students affects their SAT scores. The end thing that I found
                        was that changing funding per student, does impact their SAT, but that other
                        factors seem to play a larger role.

                        has a class that is required to take if you are a computer science
                        major. In your junior to senior year you have to take a class called field
                        session. This is where companies bring problems that they need help
                        solving to us. Basically an internship, but run through the school for credit.
                        We use Agile Methodologies to design and implement a viable product that solves
                        the problem for our customer (the companies).
                        My team and I worked with
                        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-walker-a6629423" target="_blank">Walker Water LLC</a>
                        , who wished to simulate water flowing down a mountain based on snowmelt
                        calculated from virtual weather stations. The end goal for the project was
                        to have a more accurate idea of how much water will leave the snowpack in a mountain,
                        how much will reach a reservoir, and then use that information to make more informed
                        decisions on water usage rules. In the team, my job was to create documentation
                        for the legacy code, and to implement our code into the legacy code.

                    My personal Projects are a way for me to generally test out different
                    ideas for how something works. They are a way for me to mess around with some
                    library and figure out how to use it for something larger later.

                        In my statistical modeling class, we learned about the math behind R's lm function.
                        For those unaware, this function can take in data, a linear equation, and then output
                        the coefficients for that equation, as well as if a coefficient helps explain variance in the model.
                        To determine if I had learned the math correctly, I went and wrote code to do the math in Python.
                        As of currently, the lm model works correctly, and I am trying to 1) allow for variable names i
                        the equation, and 2) allow for a user to take an R's lm summary output and compare it to this one's output.

                        For this project, I encountered a Python library called Questionary. It is a library that, when a program
                        with the library is called, can have a user enter things into the command line in a way like an HTML form input.
                        You can limit a user to a selection of choices, you can ask a user to confirm a choice, and so many other things.
                        It basically allows you to get a user input with automatic validation.
                        I used the library in a quick little code to parse an email, and then write it to
                        a Json file for storage.

                The images used for the Personal Projects were taken from the web. For PythonAsR, I got the image from 
                <a href="https://mattsosna.com/R-to-Python/" target="_blank">Perspectives on Python after R</a>, and for the EmailStoreAndCheck
                I took a screenshot of the example on the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/questionary/" target="_blank">questionary documentation</a> page.
