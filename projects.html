                    My personal Projects are a way for me to generally test out different
                    ideas for how something works. They are a way for me to mess around with some
                    library and figure out how to use it for something larger later.

                        In my statistical modeling class, we learned about the math behind R's lm function.
                        For those unaware, this function can take in data, a linear equation, and then output
                        the coefficients for that equation, as well as if a coefficient helps explain variance in the model.
                        To determine if I had learned the math correctly, I went and wrote code to do the math in Python.
                        As of currently, the lm model works correctly, and I am trying to 1) allow for variable names i
                        the equation, and 2) allow for a user to take an R's lm summary output and compare it to this one's output.

                        For this project, I encountered a Python library called Questionary. It is a library that, when a program
                        with the library is called, can have a user enter things into the command line in a way like an HTML form input.
                        You can limit a user to a selection of choices, you can ask a user to confirm a choice, and so many other things.
                        It basically allows you to get a user input with automatic validation.
                        I used the library in a quick little code to parse an email, and then write it to
                        a Json file for storage.

                The images used for the Personal Projects were taken from the web. For PythonAsR, I got the image from 
                <a href="https://mattsosna.com/R-to-Python/" target="_blank">Perspectives on Python after R</a>, and for the EmailStoreAndCheck
                I took a screenshot of the example on the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/questionary/" target="_blank">questionary documentation</a> page.
