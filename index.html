                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a computer science student at Colorado School of Mines, with a focus on data science. 
                    I am graduating with a bachelor's degree in December 2024. I have been a teaching assistant for introductory computer science 
                    at Colorado School of Mines for two and a half years and am currently trying to find a job.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am passionate about coding and figuring out how to solve problems with code. In my free time I like to read, 
                    take walks, and if I have the time, weld some sculptures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to pursue a career that will challenge me to both grow, and help make the world a better place.
